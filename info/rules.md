Keep in mind that hackathons are kind of like marathons. Some people participate to compete and win, but most people take part to learn something new and have fun. Whatever the reason is you’re joining us, make sure you’re honoring the hacker spirit by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.

## Hack Projects

- You can choose any idea to work on, as long as you’re not using previously written code.
- To make it a bit easier to choose an idea — we’re offering industry challenges as an inspiration to you. Hacking one of those helps to solve real industry pain points & qualifies for more prizes.
- The hack project MUST be open source.
- All work on the project must be done at the hackathon.

## Teams

- You’ll have a chance to meet fellow hackers, discuss ideas and form teams during social times, breakfast, lunch and right after tech talks. Check out full schedule.
- At the time of forming teams (2:00pm-2:30pm) we’ll ask you to propose your hack idea to the crowd and invite hackers to join your team. Not everyone will author an idea and that’s fine — if you don’t have one, just join another team.
- All teams must be open for accepting team members. In the spirit of an open source technology hackathon — no closed / private teams please.
- We don’t have minimum or maximum size for a team, but keep it fair. A team with over 6–7 members might end up having purely people-hours advantage over a 2 members team. If your idea attracted a lot of people — split it up into several projects tackling different angles.
- We encourage everyone to spend at least 30 minutes of your time to share your knowledge with others - meet the teams, learn what they are working on, offer help brainstorming, researching, providing peer review & feedback, contributing code AND earn some bounties for that.

## Submissions

- All projects must be submitted by 2pm on October 25 in order to qualify to present and win prizes.
- Projects must be submitted via GitHub
- Each submission must have a name, description, list of technologies used, list of team members and their roles and whether your project is competing for one of the hackathon challenges.

## Presenting

- Presentations will take place from around 2pm to 5pm on October 25th.
- Each presentation is 3 minutes long + 5 minutes for questions and feedback. We encourage your entire team to come up in front of the judges.
- The order of presentations will be determined and announced on the spot.
- All teams are highly encouraged to present their hack to the community. It’s OK if you haven’t finished and your hack is not in its perfect state. The community and the judges will want to see the evidence of your effort and persistence in solving your challenge.
- In case you don’t have anything to demo, you can still present your idea, what you tried out and what you learned in the process.

## Prizes

- The prizes will be distributed through gitcoin by creating an issue with the total amount for prizes and they will be divided among selected projects by the judges.
- Community winner will be determined by voting via Bounties Network which also earns you bounties.
- Projects qualify for prizes only if they’re properly and timely submitted and presented in front of the judges.
