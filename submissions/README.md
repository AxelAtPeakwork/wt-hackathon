commit and start a pull request* option.

That is all!

## how to submit

Seems like you have a finished project you want to submit,
we've tried to make it as simple as possible. You just need to
create a Pull Request in this repository by copying a file
in `submissions/2019` folder under your desired name and fill
all the details.

Bear in mind, all projects must have its own git repository,
the code must licensed under some open-source licence (eg: BSD,
MIT, Apaache, GPL, ...). Repository needs to be linked in the
description file.

Only merged files in the `submissions/2019` will be judged by
the comittee.

Thanks for all the submissions!
